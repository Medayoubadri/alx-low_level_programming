# 0x03. C - Debugging

## Description

This project focuses on debugging techniques in C programming. Debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors from computer software. As you progress through this project, you'll learn how to use debugging tools and techniques to find and fix bugs in your code.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Multiple mains

**Objective:** Create a file `0-main.c` that tests the function `positive_or_negative()`.

Create a `main` function in `0-main.c` that calls `positive_or_negative()` with the argument `98`. Create a `main.h` header file with the function prototype for `positive_or_negative`. Implement the `positive_or_negative` function in `positive_or_negative.c`.

### Task 1: Like, comment, subscribe

**Objective:** Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Modify the `1-main.c` file to prevent the infinite loop while keeping the code structure intact for educational purposes.

### Task 2: 0 > 972?

**Objective:** Fix the code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

Ensure that the function `largest_number` correctly identifies the largest of three integers and update `main.h` if necessary.

### Task 3: Leap year

**Objective:** Fix the code in `3-print_remaining_days.c` so that it correctly takes into account leap years.

Ensure that the function `print_remaining_days` correctly calculates the number of days remaining in the year, taking into account leap years. Update `main.h` and create the necessary supporting files.
