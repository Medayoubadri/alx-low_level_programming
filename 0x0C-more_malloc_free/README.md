# Project: 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

## Description

This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`, and `calloc`. You will learn how to manage memory efficiently and avoid memory leaks, which is crucial for building robust programs.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`
- Code must follow the Betty style.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The standard library is allowed.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Trust no one

Write a function that allocates memory using `malloc`.

### Task 1: string_nconcat

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

### Task 2: _calloc

Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using `malloc`.

### Task 3: array_range

Write a function that creates an array of integers.

### Task 4: _realloc

Write a function that reallocates a memory block using `malloc` and `free`.

### Task 5: We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope

Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers.
