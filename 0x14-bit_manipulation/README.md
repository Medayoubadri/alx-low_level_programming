# Project: 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

## Description

Welcome to the dark arts of bit manipulation, where we wield the power of binary like wizards wielding wands. This project dives deep into the binary world, tackling tasks like converting binary to unsigned integers, checking endianness, flipping bits, and more. You'll be shifting bits like a pro and questioning your life choices by the end of it.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use _putchar
- You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded


## Tasks

### Task 0: Binary to Unsigned Int

- **File:** `0-binary_to_uint.c`
- **Description:** Convert a binary number to an unsigned int. It's like translating a secret code that nobody asked you to decipher.

### Task 1: Print Binary

- **File:** `1-print_binary.c`
- **Description:** Print the binary representation of a number. Warning: May cause flashbacks to when you thought programming was easy.

### Task 2: Get Bit

- **File:** `2-get_bit.c`
- **Description:** Returns the value of a bit at a given index. Because sometimes, you just need to know if that one bit is slacking off.

### Task 3: Set Bit

- **File:** `3-set_bit.c`
- **Description:** Set the value of a bit to 1 at a given index. It's like giving a bit the promotion it never asked for.

### Task 4: Clear Bit

- **File:** `4-clear_bit.c`
- **Description:** Sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index. Flipped this bit to zero, unlike your attention span which is perpetually on ‘off’.

### Task 5: Flip Bits

- **File:** `5-flip_bits.c`
- **Description:** Returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another. Finding how many bits need flipping—just like counting how many times you've already screwed up today.

### Task 6: Check Endianness

- **File:** `6-get_endianness.c`
- **Description:** Checks the endianness of the system. Because sometimes, even computers can have terrible habits.

### Task 7: Find the Password

- **File:** `101-password`
- **Description:** Find and save the password from a provided file. No new lines, no extra spaces—just the password, plain and simple.

## Final Note

Congratulations on surviving bit manipulation! You’re now officially more fluent in binary than most people are in their native language. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility—use your bit-flipping skills wisely, or just for fun, we don't judge.
