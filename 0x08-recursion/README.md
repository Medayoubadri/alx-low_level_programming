# Project: 0x08. C - Recursion

## Description

This project explores the concept of recursion in C programming. Recursion is a powerful technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. The tasks in this project cover a range of problems that can be solved using recursion, such as string manipulation, mathematical calculations, and more.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept of recursion and how to implement it in C.
- Learn how to solve problems using recursive functions.
- Gain experience with string manipulation and mathematical recursion.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`
- Code must follow the Betty style.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- The standard library is allowed.

## Tasks

### Task 0: She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget

Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: `void _puts_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 1: Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together

Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

- Prototype: `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 2: Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange

Write a function that returns the length of a string.

- Prototype: `int _strlen_recursion(char *s);`

### Task 3: You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling

Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

- Prototype: `int factorial(int n);`

### Task 4: Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate

Write a function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`.

- Prototype: `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);`

### Task 5: Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer

Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

- Prototype: `int _sqrt_recursion(int n);`

### Task 6: Inception. Is it possible?

Write a function that returns `1` if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return `0`.

- Prototype: `int is_prime_number(int n);`

### Task 7: They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything

Write a function that returns `1` if a string is a palindrome and `0` if not.

- Prototype: `int is_palindrome(char *s);`

### Task 8: Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...

Write a function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return `0`.

- Prototype: `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`
