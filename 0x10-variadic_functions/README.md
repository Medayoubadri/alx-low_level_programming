# Project: 0x10. C - Variadic functions

## Description
This project focuses on variadic functions in C programming. You'll learn how to create functions that accept a variable number of arguments, allowing for more flexible and dynamic code.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
- Code must follow the Betty style
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The standard library is allowed

## Tasks

### Task 0: Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant
**File:** `0-sum_them_all.c`

Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.

### Task 1: To be is to be the value of a variable
**File:** `1-print_numbers.c`

Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.

### Task 2: One woman's constant is another woman's variable
**File:** `2-print_strings.c`

Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.

### Task 3: To be is a to be the value of a variable
**File:** `3-print_all.c`

Write a function that prints anything.

Why did the string crossed the river? Because it wanted to be in D-nil! Just something to think about while your code compiles.
