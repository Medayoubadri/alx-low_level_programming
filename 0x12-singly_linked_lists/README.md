# Project: 0x12. C - Singly Linked Lists

## Description
This project delves into the essential concepts of singly linked lists in C. You’ll learn how to create, traverse, and manipulate these lists through a series of tasks that build on each other. We’ll even dip our toes into the world of assembly language for a special finale!

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`
- Code must follow the Betty style
- Global variables are not allowed
- You are not allowed to use the standard library except for `printf`
- The program should be written in C unless specified otherwise

## Tasks

### Task 0: Print List
**File:** `0-print_list.c`

Write a function that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list. This function should return the number of nodes and handle `NULL` strings gracefully. It's like printing out a to-do list, but this time, in C!

### Task 1: List Length
**File:** `1-list_len.c`

Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list. Think of it as counting how many things you still have left on that to-do list—let’s hope it’s not over 9000!

### Task 2: Add Node
**File:** `2-add_node.c`

Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list. This function duplicates the string and puts it at the front of the line, like giving someone a VIP pass.

### Task 3: Add Node at the End
**File:** `3-add_node_end.c`

Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list. Imagine you’re adding the cherry on top of a sundae—this node goes at the very end of the list!

### Task 4: Free List
**File:** `4-free_list.c`

Write a function that frees a `list_t` list. Just like letting go of old junk you no longer need, this function frees up memory by saying goodbye to each node.

### Task 5: The Hare and the Tortoise
**File:** `100-first.c`

Write a function that prints a specific message before the `main` function is executed. Sometimes the slow and steady approach wins, but this time, it’s just about being first to print!

### Task 6: Real Programmers Can Write Assembly Code in Any Language
**File:** `101-hello_holberton.asm`

Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints `Hello, Holberton`, followed by a new line. Real programmers write in assembly, because who doesn’t want to feel like Neo in *The Matrix*?

Did you know that *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy was filmed simultaneously over an eight-year period, creating one of the most epic movie series ever? It’s like compiling the most complex C program ever written—except with hobbits and elves.
