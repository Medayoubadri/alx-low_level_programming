# Project: 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

## Description
This project dives into the magical world of C preprocessors, focusing on macros. You'll learn how to create and use different types of macros, which can save you a lot of time and make your code more readable.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
- Code must follow the Betty style.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The standard library is allowed.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Object-like Macros FTW
**File:** `0-object_like_macro.h`

Create a header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as `1024`.

### Task 1: Mmm Pi
**File:** `1-pi.h`

Create a header file that defines a macro named `PI` as `3.14159265359`.

### Task 2: File Name Fanatic
**File:** `2-main.c`

Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.

### Task 3: Big Bad Function-like Macro
**File:** `3-function_like_macro.h`

Create a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number.

### Task 4: Summing It Up
**File:** `4-sum.h`

Create a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.

Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Can you imagine if you lather yourself with it you'll become a immortal or a mummy at least...
