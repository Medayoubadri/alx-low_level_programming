# Project: 0x0F. C - Function pointers

## Description
This project explores function pointers in C programming. You'll learn how to define, use, and pass function pointers as arguments, which can make your code more flexible and reusable.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
- Code must follow the Betty style
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The standard library is allowed

## Tasks

### Task 0: What's my name
**File:** `0-print_name.c`

Write a function that prints a name using a function pointer.

### Task 1: If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
**File:** `1-array_iterator.c`

Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

### Task 2: To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
**File:** `2-int_index.c`

Write a function that searches for an integer in an array using a comparison function.

### Task 3: A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at
**File:** `3-calc.h`, `3-op_functions.c`, `3-get_op_func.c`, `3-main.c`

Write a program that performs simple operations using function pointers.

### Task 4: Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker
**File:** `100-main_opcodes.c`

Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

Why did the programmer go broke? Because he used up all his cache! I'll see my self out...
