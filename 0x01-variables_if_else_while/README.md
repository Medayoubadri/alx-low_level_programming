# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This project covers the basics of variables, conditional statements, and loops in C programming. The tasks involve writing C programs that make use of these concepts to perform various operations and produce specific outputs.

## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- **File**: `0-positive_or_negative.c`
- **Description**: This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.

### 1. The last digit
- **File**: `1-last_digit.c`
- **Description**: This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed and prints the last digit of the number stored in `n`.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
- **File**: `2-print_alphabet.c`
- **Description**: This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Only the `putchar` function is used.

### 3. alphABET
- **File**: `3-print_alphabets.c`
- **Description**: This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. Only the `putchar` function is used.

### 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
- **File**: `4-print_alphabt.c`
- **Description**: This program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, except for the letters `q` and `e`. Only the `putchar` function is used.

### 5. Numbers
- **File**: `5-print_numbers.c`
- **Description**: This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

### 6. Numberz
- **File**: `6-print_numberz.c`
- **Description**: This program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function and without using any variable of type `char`.

### 7. Smile in the mirror
- **File**: `7-print_tebahpla.c`
- **Description**: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. Only the `putchar` function is used.

### 8. Hexadecimal
- **File**: `8-print_base16.c`
- **Description**: This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. Only the `putchar` function is used.

### 9. Patience, persistence, and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success
- **File**: `9-print_comb.c`
- **Description**: This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space. Only the `putchar` function is used.

### 10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
- **File**: `100-print_comb3.c`
- **Description**: This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits. Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space. Only the `putchar` function is used.

### 11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...
- **File**: `101-print_comb4.c`
- **Description**: This program prints all possible different combinations of three digits. Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space. Only the `putchar` function is used.

### 12. Software is eating the World
- **File**: `102-print_comb5.c`
- **Description**: This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. Numbers must be separated by a space. Only the `putchar` function is used.
