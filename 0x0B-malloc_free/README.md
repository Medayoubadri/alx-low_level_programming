# Project: 0x0B. C - malloc, free

## Description

This project focuses on dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`, and `calloc`. You will learn how to manage memory efficiently and avoid memory leaks, which is crucial for building robust programs.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`
- Code must follow the Betty style.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- The standard library is allowed.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee

Write a function that creates an array of chars and initializes it with a specific char.

### Task 1: The woman who has no imagination has no wings

Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

### Task 2: He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

### Task 3: If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize

Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a 2-dimensional array of integers.

### Task 4: It's not bragging if you can back it up

Write a function that frees a 2-dimensional grid previously created by your `alloc_grid` function.

### Task 5: It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe

Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

### Task 6: I will show you how great I am

Write a function that splits a string into words.

Remember, when life gives you malloc errors, just free up some space... or maybe just some time. ðŸ˜œ
Also, always keep a rubber duck on your desk. It's scientifically proven to debug your code faster!
