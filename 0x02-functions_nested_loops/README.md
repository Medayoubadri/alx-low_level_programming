# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

## Description
This project involves practicing C programming with a focus on functions and nested loops. The tasks include writing various functions to handle specific problems, such as printing the alphabet, checking for lowercase characters, and generating Fibonacci numbers.

## Tasks

### 0. _putchar
Write a program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line. The program should return 0.

### 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

### 2. 10 x alphabet
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

### 3. islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

### 4. isalpha
Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

### 5. Sign
Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

### 6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

### 7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

### 8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

### 9. Learn your times table
Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

### 10. a + b
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. 98 Battery Street, the OG
Write a function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line.

### 12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself
Write a function that prints the `n` times table, starting with 0. If `n` is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything.

### 13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women
Write a function that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded).

### 14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 50 Fibonacci numbers
Write a function that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`. The numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space `, `.

### 15. Even Liber Abbaci
Write a function that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000.

### 16. 98 Battery Street, the OG (advanced)
Write a function that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2. The numbers should be separated by a comma followed by a space `, `. The program should be able to handle very large numbers.
